## Asking quality questions

Questions can go to DMs on Discord.

Help me help you!
Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.
Here are some tips:

*   Donâ€™t fall for the [XY problem][xy]
*   Search to find out if a similar question has been asked
*   Screenshots can help, but if thereâ€™s important text such as code or error
    messages in them, please also provide those as text
*   The less time you put into asking your question, the less I can help you.
    Not enough information = nothing I can do.
    Too many words = too long, won't read.
