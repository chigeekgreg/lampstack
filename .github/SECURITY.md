## Security

I take the security of my software seriously, except for this open source code repository since it is not a real project.

Even though this is not a real project, I will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate bin for remediation. 

## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository, please do not tell me about it. 
There is really nothing original about this repository. If you found a real problem, it probably came from somewhere else.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an double-rot13 ciphered message via carrier pigeon.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

  * The type of issue (e.g., can't read, can't follow directions, or just can't understand)
  * Full digits of the sauce
  * The location of the sauce
  * Any magic words required to reproduce
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
  * Proof-of-work or crypto wallet (if possible)
